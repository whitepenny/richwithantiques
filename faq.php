<dt>What is an Antique Picker?</dt>
<dd>Antique Pickers are specialists who have an eye for finding antiques, collectibles, and other valuable items.  They go to flea markets and garage sales, scour ads in the paper for antique sale items, and even literally go door to door, hoping to explore an abandoned barn or a basement or attic packed with junk…and gems!  Antique dealers rely on Pickers to provide them with merchandise for their shops.  Collectors, set designers, museum curators, and decorators are also regular clients.  Without Antique Pickers, many antique stores would go out of business, and some historical artifacts would never have made their way into display cases.  Success as a Picker comes from having a good eye, a solid knowledge of antiques, and an excellent reputation.  Most Antique Pickers love antiques and the freedom they have to work for themselves, set their own schedule, and go where they want for the thrill of the hunt.</dd>

<dt>Are you just like the guys on The History Channel’s “American Picker?”</dt>
<dd>Like the stars on the show, I travel the Philadelphia area and Delaware Valley looking to buy all kinds of items, but where they are looking for tin cans and old bicycles, I am interested in buying fine art, oil paintings, high quality furniture, coins, jewelry, sterling tea sets, and other unique and interesting things.</dd>

<dt>Where do you travel?</dt>
<dd>I live in Haddonfield, New Jersey, and I basically travel within a 2 hour radius of my home, which encompasses the Greater Philadelphia Area.</dd>

<dt>How long have you been an Antique Picker?  </dt>
<dd>Since 1994.</dd>

<dt>What is one item you’ve searched for and been unable to find?</dt>
<dd>A painting by Fern Coppedge, the Bucks County artist.</dd>

<dt>Do you have a shop?</dt>
<dd>No, I’m strictly a buyer.  I buy for private collectors, designers, and galleries.</dd>

<dt>What is the oldest item you’ve found?</dt>
<dd>An Egyptian figure from 380 B.C.</dd>
